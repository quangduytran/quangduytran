👋 Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub!

👶🏻🌍 I'm a proud parent who loves capturing precious moments of my baby boy. That's why I created Tin Tin, a website that's dedicated to showcasing all of his milestones and special moments.

📷 It's been an incredible way to document his growth and development, and I'm thrilled to have a digital scrapbook that we can all look back on and cherish.

🌟 Check out Tin Tin at https://tintin.world and feel free to share any feedback or suggestions. Thanks for stopping by!

🏠 In my free time, I love playing a fun game called 2048 Naruto Fan. 🎮🍥

👥 This game is inspired by the popular anime series, Naruto, and it's a great way to challenge myself while also enjoying some nostalgia.

🕹️ If you're interested in checking it out, feel free to play it at https://quangduytran.github.io/naruto/. Let me know what you think!
